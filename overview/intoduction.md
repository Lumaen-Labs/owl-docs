# Introduction

## The Problem

Traditional DeFi lending requires overcollateralization. To borrow $100, you need to deposit $150-200 in collateral. This is capital inefficient and limits profit potential.

## Our Solution  

Owl Finance enables undercollateralized lending through:

1. **Controlled deployment** - Borrowed funds can only be used in whitelisted protocols
2. **Credit verification** - Users can verify credentials to unlock higher leverage
3. **Automated risk management** - Positions are monitored and liquidated automatically
4. **Restaking security** - Additional economic security through validator-backed collateral

## How It Works

Users deposit collateral and can borrow up to 10x the value (15x with verification). Borrowed funds are deployed directly to integrated protocols like Jupiter, Orca, Drift, and Kamino. The protocol monitors positions in real-time and automatically liquidates if health factors drop below safe thresholds.

## Who Can Benefit

**Lenders** earn sustainable yields from borrower interest without impermanent loss.

**Borrowers** access leverage to amplify DeFi strategies and maximize returns.

**Traders** can execute leveraged trades across multiple protocols seamlessly.
