## ðŸ¦‰ **Owl Finance: Restaking-Backed Credit Layer on Solana**

### Abstract

Owl Finance introduces an undercollateralized credit framework built natively on **Solana**, powered by **zkTLS-based off-chain data verification** and **restaking collateral mechanisms**.
Unlike conventional overcollateralized lending, Owl Finance enables borrowers to access leverage and credit using *reputation-weighted, data-proven scores*, secured by the capital staked and restaked across validators and liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) like JitoSOL.

The protocol blends **data verifiability**, **economic alignment**, and **modular risk control** to create a scalable foundation for trust-minimized credit markets â€” without introducing a native inflationary token.
Owl Finance leverages Solanaâ€™s parallel transaction architecture, program-derived accounts (PDAs), and composable DeFi primitives to enable capital-efficient lending that is fast, transparent, and credibly neutral.

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 The Problem

DeFi lending protocols today primarily operate in **overcollateralized** models (e.g., Aave, Compound, Solend). Borrowers must lock capital exceeding the loan value, which limits utility and capital velocity.
Attempts at **undercollateralized** credit (e.g., Maple, Goldfinch) rely heavily on off-chain identity or manual credit assessment â€” introducing centralization, opaque risk, and custodial control.

The missing link in on-chain credit markets is a **verifiable bridge** between a userâ€™s behavioral data (trading, staking, liquidity provisioning, historical repayments) and an automated, trustless scoring mechanism that can be verified cryptographically â€” without exposing sensitive data or relying on intermediaries.

#### 1.2 The Opportunity

Owl Finance leverages:

* **zkTLS**: To bring authenticated Web2 / off-chain reputation data on-chain securely.
* **Restaking**: To create a base layer of economic trust by tying credit to validator collateral.
* **Solana runtime efficiency**: To process multiple credit and liquidation instructions atomically in a single slot.

This allows Owl Finance to define **creditworthiness as an earned, cryptographically proven privilege**, rather than an off-chain reputation signal.

### 2. System Overview

#### 2.1 Participants

* **Borrowers** â€” users requesting leverage or loans based on their verifiable on-chain/off-chain score.
* **Lenders** â€” liquidity providers supplying assets to lending pools for yield.
* **Restakers** â€” users delegating LSD collateral (e.g., JitoSOL) to reinforce protocol security.
* **Protocol Engine** â€” Solana programs handling loan issuance, repayment, liquidation, and score validation.
* **zkTLS Verifier** â€” off-chain computation system generating proofs of verified data for on-chain validation.

#### 2.2 Protocol Layers

1. **Data Layer:** zkTLS proofs convert trusted off-chain data (like exchange history or verified ID) into verifiable inputs.
2. **Scoring Layer:** Computes a deterministic score from both on-chain activity and zkTLS inputs.
3. **Credit Engine:** Issues or denies loans based on the verified score and available liquidity.
4. **Restaking Layer:** Ensures loans are economically secured via validator-backed capital commitments.
5. **Risk Engine:** Defines thresholds, health factors, and liquidation rules.

### 3. Technical Architecture

#### 3.1 Solana Program Design

The core smart contract suite (Anchor-based) includes:

* `core_router` â€” entry point handling all instruction dispatching.
* `score_verifier` â€” updates and verifies borrower scores.
* `credit_pool` â€” manages lending, repayment, and liquidation logic.
* `restake_registry` â€” manages staked/restaked collateral and validator relations.

Each borrower and lender are represented via **PDA accounts** derived from a global seed (`user_pubkey`, `program_id`), enabling deterministic state mapping and preventing collisions.

Example instruction flow:

```rust
// Borrow request
pub fn borrow(ctx: Context<Borrow>, amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    let user_score = ctx.accounts.user_score.load()?;
    require!(user_score.value > MIN_SCORE, CreditError::LowScore);
    let pool = &mut ctx.accounts.credit_pool;
    pool.issue_loan(ctx.accounts.user.key(), amount)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

#### 3.2 Score Update Flow

Borrower scores are derived via:

1. Off-chain data verification using zkTLS adapters (e.g., trading volume, repayment history).
2. A **converter module** (Rust) transforms the off-chain verified data into a standardized `ScoreUpdate` struct.
3. `core_router` program submits updates directly on Solana via a signed transaction, temporarily acting as oracle authority (until decentralized oracles are added).

Example:

```rust
pub fn update_score(ctx: Context<UpdateScore>, new_score: u64) -> Result<()> {
    let score_account = &mut ctx.accounts.score;
    score_account.value = new_score;
    score_account.last_updated = Clock::get()?.unix_timestamp;
    Ok(())
}
```

Later, this authority will be delegated to on-chain oracle networks supporting the `IOracleShu` interface (as you built for Djed Shu).

#### 3.3 Restaking Integration

Owl Finance integrates **JitoSOL restaking** to bootstrap economic security:

* Restaked collateral is used to guarantee loan pools and mitigate systemic risk.
* Defaulted positions can be resolved via restaked capital slashing or insurance reserves.
* This aligns incentives: lenders are secured by validator-backed collateral, while validators earn from protocol fees.

### 4. Protocol Economics

#### 4.1 Capital Efficiency

Owlâ€™s undercollateralized lending design boosts capital velocity:

* Borrowers no longer need 150% collateral; instead, **creditworthiness** defines borrowing limits.
* The risk-adjusted loan-to-value (LTV) is dynamically set via the score engine:

  [
  LTV = \text{BaseLTV} + (\text{ScoreMultiplier} \times \text{VerifiedScore})
  ]

  where `VerifiedScore` âˆˆ [0, 1] is normalized after zkTLS verification.

#### 4.2 Fee Model

* **Borrow interest:** dynamic rate based on pool utilization.
* **Protocol fee:** small cut of interest distributed to restakers.
* **Penalty fee:** for late repayments or score downgrades.
* **Liquidation fee:** shared between liquidator and insurance pool.

#### 4.3 No Native Token

Owl Finance currently operates **without a governance or utility token** to prevent unnecessary inflation and speculative pressure.
All protocol incentives are powered by **real yield** (interest, restaking rewards, and liquidation fees).
Governance and incentive tokens may be introduced only after full decentralization of oracles and restaking modules.

### 5. Risk and Security Framework

#### 5.1 zkTLS Proof Integrity

Each off-chain verification is tied to:

* Domain-bound certificates
* Time-locked proofs
* Cryptographic attestation of data freshness

This ensures the system cannot be gamed by replaying old or invalid proofs.

#### 5.2 On-Chain Risk Parameters

The on-chain **Risk Engine** monitors:

* Collateral-to-loan ratios
* Score decay over time
* Validator restake health
* Liquidation thresholds

Automatic liquidation triggers if:
[
\text{Health Factor} = \frac{\text{Collateral Value} \times \text{Score Weight}}{\text{Borrowed Value}} < 1.0
]

#### 5.3 Protocol Security

* **Audited Solana programs** built with Anchor framework.
* **Unit + integration testing** through localnet and mock oracle adapters.
* **Permissioned submission** of score updates during initial rollout phase.
* **Event logging + monitoring** for replay and reentrancy protection.

### 6. Future Work

1. **Oracle Decentralization:** Replace centralized backend score submitter with a multi-party oracle network using the IOracleShu adapter.
2. **zkTLS Enhancements:** Integration with off-chain financial identity data (banking, exchange KYC).
3. **Cross-Program Composability:** Plug-and-play leverage integrations with protocols like Drift, MarginFi, and Kamino.
4. **Automated Insurance Layer:** Liquidity-backed insurance pool funded by restaking yield.
5. **Governance DAO:** Transition toward community-managed parameters and protocol upgrades.

---

### 7. Conclusion

Owl Finance redefines on-chain credit by merging **restaking security**, **zk-verifiable data**, and **capital-efficient lending** â€” all within the composable Solana ecosystem.
It removes the historical dependency on off-chain intermediaries and transforms user reputation into a cryptographically verified, economically secured asset.

By anchoring every credit action to real validator-backed capital and verifiable data integrity, Owl Finance lays the foundation for a sustainable, scalable undercollateralized DeFi system â€” **a trust layer for the next generation of decentralized finance.**
