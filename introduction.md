## Introduction

Owl Finance is a **Solana-based undercollateralized credit layer** combining restaking-backed security and zkTLS-verified borrower data. It consists of a modular set of Anchor programs that interact through the **Core Router**, which handles instruction routing and ensures atomic execution.

The architecture is designed to:

* Allow **data-verifiable, trust-minimized lending**
* Enable **credit scoring from zkTLS proofs**
* Integrate **restaked collateral** for additional security
* Maintain **speed, parallelism, and composability** on Solana
