# ðŸ’³ Credit Score

The Owl credit score enables true undercollateralized lending by verifying user credentials and DeFi history. Higher scores unlock increased leverage and better interest rates.

### Leverage Tiers

| Score Range | Tier       | Max Leverage | Interest Discount |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| 0-300       | Unverified | 10x          | Base rate         |
| 301-500     | Bronze     | 12x          | -2%               |
| 501-750     | Silver     | 13x          | -3%               |
| 751-1000    | Gold       | 15x          | -5%               |

### Benefits of Verification

With the same $1,000 collateral:

* **Unverified**: Borrow up to $10,000 at 15% APR
* **Gold Verified**: Borrow up to $15,000 at 10% APR

This represents 50% more borrowing power and 33% lower interest rates for verified users.

### Privacy

We use zero-knowledge proofs to verify credentials without accessing or storing personal data. The protocol only stores your score, not your underlying information.

### Future Roadmap

* **Phase 1** (Current): Extra leverage with collateral
* **Phase 2**: Reduced collateral requirements for verified users
* **Phase 3**: Zero collateral loans for Gold tier users
