# ðŸ’¸ Lenders

### Earn Sustainable Yield

Lenders are the backbone of Owl Finance, providing liquidity that borrowers use for leveraged positions.

### How Lending Works

1. **Deposit Assets**: Supply USDC, USDT, or SOL to lending pools
2. **Earn Interest**: Receive continuous interest from borrowers
3. **Compound Automatically**: Interest compounds every block
4. **Withdraw Anytime**: Remove funds whenever you want (subject to availability)

### Current Rates

| Asset | Supply APY | Total Supplied | Utilization |
| ----- | ---------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| USDC  | 12.5%      | $5.2M          | 75%         |
| USDT  | 11.8%      | $3.1M          | 72%         |
| SOL   | 8.2%       | 15,000 SOL     | 68%         |
