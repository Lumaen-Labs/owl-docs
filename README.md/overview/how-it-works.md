# üç≥ How it Works

#### Step 1: Supply Collateral

Deposit any supported asset as collateral. Even $100 is enough to start.

#### Step 2: Borrow with Leverage

Based on your collateral, borrow up to 10x the value.

#### Step 3: Deploy Capital

Use borrowed funds in integrated protocols:

* Trade on Jupiter or Drift
* Provide liquidity on Orca or Raydium
* Farm yields on Kamino or Tulip

#### Step 4: Manage Position

Monitor your health factor and P\&L in real-time.

#### Step 5: Repay or Get Liquidated

Close positions profitably and repay, or get liquidated if health drops too low.

### Example Walkthrough

**Alice has $1,000 USDC**

1. She deposits $1,000 as collateral
2. Borrows $7,000 USDC (7x leverage)
3. Deploys to USDC-SOL LP on Orca
4. Earns 40% APY on $7,000 = $2,800/year
5. Pays 15% interest on $7,000 = $1,050/year
6. **Net profit: $1,750/year (175% on her $1,000)**

Without Owl: 40% on $1,000 = $400/year With Owl: 175% effective APY

### The Magic: Controlled Deployment

Borrowed funds never hit your wallet directly. Instead:

* Funds are deployed atomically to strategies
* Positions are owned by smart contracts
* You control the positions but can't withdraw borrowed funds
* Only profits (after repayment) can be withdrawn

This ensures: ‚úÖ No risk of borrowed funds being stolen ‚úÖ Clear tracking of all positions ‚úÖ Automated risk management ‚úÖ Efficient liquidations if needed
