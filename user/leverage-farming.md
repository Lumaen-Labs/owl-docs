# Leverage Farming

## Overview

Leverage farming uses borrowed capital to amplify yield farming returns. Instead of farming with only your capital, borrow additional funds to increase position size and yields.

## Strategy Comparison

**Traditional Farming**
- Capital: $1,000
- APY: 20%
- Annual return: $200

**5x Leverage Farming**  
- Capital: $1,000
- Borrowed: $4,000
- Total position: $5,000
- Yield: 20% on $5,000 = $1,000
- Interest: 15% on $4,000 = $600
- Net return: $400 (40% ROI)

## Available Strategies

### Stable Farming
- **Risk**: Low
- **APY**: 15-25%

## Integrated Protocols

**Orca**: Concentrated and standard liquidity pools
**Raydium**: Standard AMM and concentrated liquidity

**Tulip**: Auto-compounding vaults

## Risk Management

### Key Metrics
- **Health Factor**: Keep above 1.5 for safety
- **Impermanent Loss**: Monitor price divergence
- **Interest Coverage**: Ensure yields exceed borrowing costs

### Safety Guidelines
1. Start with lower leverage (2-3x)
2. Use stable pairs to minimize IL
3. Set stop-loss orders
4. Monitor positions regularly
5. Keep buffer collateral

## ROI Calculation
```
Net APY = (Farm APY × Leverage) - (Borrow APR × (Leverage - 1))
```

Example with 5x leverage:
- Farm APY: 30%
- Borrow APR: 15%
- Net APY = (30% × 5) - (15% × 4) = 90%
