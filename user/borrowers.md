# Borrowers

## Overview

Borrowers can access up to 10x leverage without verification, or up to 15x leverage with credit verification. Borrowed funds are deployed directly to integrated DeFi protocols.

## Leverage Tiers

| Verification Status | Max Leverage | Interest Rate | Example ($1,000 collateral) |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Unverified | 10x | 15% APR | Borrow up to $10,000 |
| Bronze | 12x | 13% APR | Borrow up to $12,000 |
| Silver | 13x | 12% APR | Borrow up to $13,000 |
| Gold | 15x | 10% APR | Borrow up to $15,000 |

## How It Works

1. **Deposit Collateral**: Minimum $100 in supported assets
2. **Choose Leverage**: Based on your verification status
3. **Deploy Capital**: Select from integrated strategies
4. **Manage Position**: Monitor health factor and P&L
5. **Repay or Liquidate**: Close positions or face liquidation if unhealthy

## Integrated Protocols

Deploy borrowed funds directly to:
- **DEXs**: Jupiter, Orca, Raydium
- **Perpetuals**: Drift, Mango Markets
- **Yield**: Kamino, Tulip, Francium

## Interest Rates

Current rates vary by asset and utilization:
- USDC: 10-15% APR
- USDT: 9-14% APR  
- SOL: 13-18% APR

Verified users receive up to 5% discount on base rates.

## Example Returns

**Unverified User** ($1,000 USDC collateral):
- Borrow: $9,000 (10x total position)
- Deploy to stable farm: 25% APY on $10,000 = $2,500
- Interest cost: 15% on $9,000 = $1,350
- Net profit: $1,150 (115% ROI)

**Gold Verified User** ($1,000 USDC collateral):
- Borrow: $14,000 (15x total position)
- Deploy to stable farm: 25% APY on $15,000 = $3,750
- Interest cost: 10% on $14,000 = $1,400
- Net profit: $2,350 (235% ROI)

Verification provides $1,200 additional profit per year in this example.
