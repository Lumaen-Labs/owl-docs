# Lenders

## Earn Sustainable Yield

Lenders are the backbone of Owl Finance, providing liquidity that borrowers use for leveraged positions.

## How Lending Works

1. **Deposit Assets**: Supply USDC, USDT, or SOL to lending pools
2. **Earn Interest**: Receive continuous interest from borrowers
3. **Compound Automatically**: Interest compounds every block
4. **Withdraw Anytime**: Remove funds whenever you want (subject to availability)
